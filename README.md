# Lumen Passport

Lumen porting of Laravel Passport.
The original repo: https://github.com/nomadnt/lumen-passport but I tried to install on my Lumen ^8.x with PHP ^8.0 and got failed, so I just copy and add some additional laravel helpers and also change a few lines of composer.json to make it work.

Installation:
```sh
composer install starlight93/oauth2
```

More instructions please go to the original page https://github.com/nomadnt/lumen-passport

Change all of the prefix namespace ```Nomadnt\LumenPassport``` with ``` Starlight93\Oauth2```

Thanks to Nomadnt!
